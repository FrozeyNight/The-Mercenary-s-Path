Walking through the sagging village gates, Oakbrook sprawls before you in a mosaic of faded grandeur and rustic simplicity. The main square, although worn around the edges, boasts a semblance of former prosperity. The tavern at the heart of it all stands proudly, its timbers well-maintained, its windows adorned with colorful curtains. A few other buildings surrounding the square also wear a decent facade, their paint, though chipped, retaining a whisper of its original vibrancy.

However, the further your gaze travels, the more the village reveals its age. Cottages, their roofs made of thatch and weathered wood, lean against each other for support. The cobblestone streets, though once meticulously laid, now bear the scars of countless footsteps and the passage of time. The stream to your left trickles gently, bordered by patches of wildflowers, offering a fleeting glimpse of nature's untamed beauty amidst the settlement's struggle.

The air is thick with the scent of wood smoke and freshly baked bread, weaving a comforting tapestry of smells. Villagers, their faces etched with the marks of hard work and determination, move about their daily tasks, casting curious glances at the newcomer in their midst.

You decide to go to the inn. Inside, the warmth of the hearth battles the chill that seeps through the cracks in the walls. The atmosphere is lively, villagers huddled around wooden tables, their laughter a comforting melody. Behind the slightly battered counter stands the tavern keeper, a middle-aged man with a welcoming grin and a glint of curiosity in his eyes.
