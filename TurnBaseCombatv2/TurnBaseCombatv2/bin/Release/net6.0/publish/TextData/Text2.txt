You find yourself standing at the outskirts of a tranquil village named Oakbrook. The scent of blooming flowers mingles with the earthy aroma of the nearby forest. Oakbrook, a peaceful hamlet surrounded by nature, but lately, its serenity has been shattered by troubling events.
 
A seasoned mercenary, you've traveled far seeking coin and adventure. The village before you seems like the perfect place to find both. As the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold, you take a moment to absorb the village's rustic charm.
 
The village gates, more like a wooden archway than a proper gate, stand ajar, and a villager, noticing your arrival, waves you in. You step inside, greeted by curious glances.
 
You have the option to explore the village further, or head straight to the heart of Oakbrook - the cozy tavern nestled near the village square.

Path1  Walking through the sagging village gates, Oakbrook sprawls before you in a mosaic of faded grandeur and rustic simplicity. The main square, although worn around the edges, boasts a semblance of former prosperity. The tavern at the heart of it all stands proudly, its timbers well-maintained, its windows adorned with colorful curtains. A few other buildings surrounding the square also wear a decent facade, their paint, though chipped, retaining a whisper of its original vibrancy.

Path1  However, the further your gaze travels, the more the village reveals its age. Cottages, their roofs made of thatch and weathered wood, lean against each other for support. The cobblestone streets, though once meticulously laid, now bear the scars of countless footsteps and the passage of time. The stream to your left trickles gently, bordered by patches of wildflowers, offering a fleeting glimpse of nature's untamed beauty amidst the settlement's struggle.

Path1  The air is thick with the scent of wood smoke and freshly baked bread, weaving a comforting tapestry of smells. Villagers, their faces etched with the marks of hard work and determination, move about their daily tasks, casting curious glances at the newcomer in their midst.

Path1  You decide to go to the inn. Inside, the warmth of the hearth battles the chill that seeps through the cracks in the walls. The atmosphere is lively, villagers huddled around wooden tables, their laughter a comforting melody. Behind the slightly battered counter stands the tavern keeper, a middle-aged man with a welcoming grin and a glint of curiosity in his eyes.

Path2  Inside, the warmth of the hearth battles the chill that seeps through the cracks in the walls. The atmosphere is lively, villagers huddled around wooden tables, their laughter a comforting melody. Behind the slightly battered counter stands the tavern keeper, a middle-aged man with a welcoming grin and a glint of curiosity in his eyes.
 
Tavern Keeper: "A new face in Oakbrook! We don't see many strangers around here. You've found your way to the heart of our village, friend. This tavern has seen its share of tales and travelers. Care for a drink, or maybe a bite to eat? And if you're looking for work, well, I might have a task or two that need doin'. Take a seat, and we can talk."
 
You settle onto a worn stool at the tavern, the tavern keeper pouring you a mug of frothy ale. With a friendly smile, he leans in, his voice lowered in a conspiratorial tone.
 
Tavern Keeper: "Glad you've chosen to heed our call for help, stranger. We've got two tasks, both as important as the other. The first one, well, it's a matter of vanished merchants. They were last seen traveling the road that leads south out of Oakbrook. No one's heard from them since, and we fear the worst. Bandits, perhaps, or something more sinister. Find out what happened to them, and there'll be a reward in it for you."
 
His gaze shifts to the window, where the fading light casts long shadows over the village square.
 
Tavern Keeper: "The second task... it's a bit more peculiar. There's an old temple deep in the forest, a place of reverence for our village. Lately, though, it's fallen into disrepair, overrun by creatures and plagued by darkness. At the heart of the temple, there's a statue of our village hero, Elara. We need you to venture into the forest, cleanse the temple, and restore the statue. It's said that Elara watches over our village, and we need her to do so now more than ever."
 
The tavern keeper's eyes glint with hope and worry, a silent plea for your help.
